# Refactoring Kata

This exercise is part of our interview process for Software Engineers.

## Getting started

You'll find folders in the root of this repo with the multiple languages we allow to execute the kata in.

Pick the one you feel more comfortable with, and familiarise yourself with the code.

## The challenge

We provide an initial implementation of a statement generator for a Movie rental business. It works, and meets all requirements, but its implementation is messy, and untested.

**We expect you to refactor the codebase to improve its maintainability without modifying its behaviour. We expect you to use [characterisation tests](http://wiki.c2.com/?CharacterizationTest) to verify you haven't introduced defects while refactoring.**

Whilst it's not mandatory that you finish all your refactoring, we expect to see a beneficial impact on the codebase within the allocated time.

### How do we rate the exercise?

We assess your performance based on:

* Clarity of code
* Your tests enable your refactor, and don't break when you refactor your code
* Prioritisation skills on what to refactor
* Critical thinking
* Adherence to S.O.L.I.D. principles
* Design Patterns used (or planning to use)
